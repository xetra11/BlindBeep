# BlindBeep

## The Problem
One day I asked myself what it would be like if I had to write code as a blind programmer. I briefly tried a few screen reader features and quickly realized that working quickly and efficiently was not the strength of those. Of course as a non-blind person I am not able to adapt quickly to screen readers and such like a real blind person would but I was quite sure there can be a better way. The syntax of programming languages is much less complex like their spoken cultural counterparts. Therefore I wanted to start a project that tries to find a solution to offer blind developers a faster and more efficient assistance when crafting code.
